Beautiful! Thank you for including the comments about the rng in the first problem. The Take home message on that one is that even with a bad rng, you can still accomplish some tasks quite well. In the importance sampling - I see that you found the tool that was the easiest to use. Jumping from MATLAB to python sometimes is advantageous.
