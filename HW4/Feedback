I'm happy that you challenged yourself to write the first problem in MATLAB. I suspect that if may have been the easier way to go. The lcm that IBM created didn't seem to have any problems until the visualization.
I'd like you to take another look at the second problem, I think you may be picking up some coincidence in your equilibrium time. The time will fluctuate, but your results are a bit erratic. I would graph the deviation values and see what's happening
